###What's server.js for?

You can't run the geolocation service from a local file - it has to come from a server.
If you don't want to upload this somewhere or start a real server you can use Node to run server.js
Assuming you have Node installed simply run

	node server.js

and then go to http://127.0.0.1:8125/index.html in your web browser

###What's this demo for?

I wanted to play with the geolocation stuff in HTML5 and everyone loves the Flickr API, right?
